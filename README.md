# My Project

## Overview
This project is a Python application designed to demonstrate the use of Docker for containerization and GitHub Actions for continuous deployment. It serves as a template for building and deploying Python applications in a streamlined manner.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-project.git
   cd my-project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```
   python app/app.py
   ```

## Usage Examples
Once the application is running, you can access it via your web browser at `http://localhost:5000` (or the appropriate port specified in `app.py`).

## Docker Instructions
To build and run the Docker container, use the following commands:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t my-python-app .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```
   docker run -p 5000:5000 my-python-app
   ```
